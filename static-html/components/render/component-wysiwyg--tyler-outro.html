				<h4>Get the support to succeed</h4><p>Ravonte attributes his renewed self-confidence to Tyler's small class sizes and the opportunities to build tight-knit relationships with his classmates and professors.</p><p>He formed independent study groups and never hesitates to reach out to his classmates for late-night problem-solving. And he says his professors go above and beyond to help him understand the material.</p><p>"If you have a question, your professors won't just tell you the answer. They will step through the problem with you so that you leave with an understanding behind the answer. Next time you have the problem, you know exactly how to handle it."</p><p>Working closely with his professor and fellow students, Ravonte helped launch Tyler's robotics team. He's leading the team's first project: building an autonomous robot for a competition at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p><h4>Turn your skills ironclad</h4><p>When he noticed a flyer recruiting STEM tutors for Tyler's Academic Resource Center, he imagined the payoff right away: Short-term he could quit his off-campus job, and long-term he could become a smarter engineer.</p><p>Now he leads 50+ student tutoring sessions a week for math, science and engineering and offers private tutoring sessions on top of those. He approaches each session differently, adapting his teaching style to how each student learns. Above all, he gets students to adopt helpful time management habits.</p><figure class="quote"><blockquote class="quote_content"><p>Being a tutor has helped me problem solve on my own. If I have a problem now, I go and find the answer. I actually look in a textbook—which I never did before.</p></blockquote><figcaption class="quote_caption"><span class="quote_caption_name">Ravonte Campbell</span></figcaption></figure><p>"I show them how to plan for homework, quizzes and tests in a calendar," Ravonte said. "Then you don't have that, 'Oh shoot, I have a test tomorrow, but I also have a four-page paper and six chapters of homework to do.'</p><p>"Being a tutor has helped me problem solve on my own," he continued. "If I have a problem now, I go and find the answer. I actually look in a textbook—which I never did before."</p><h4>Research with national scientists</h4><p>In his last semester at Tyler, Ravonte was accepted to the National Science Foundation’s Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. Between graduating from Tyler and heading to VT, he’ll go to Iowa State University and work with a research team analyzing data to determine what skills are critical for entry-level engineers in the aerospace field.</p>
