Looking at the road ahead, he couldn't picture himself enjoying the path he was making for himself.</p><p>"I was at a new school and being flooded with information," Ravonte said. "I wasn't getting the best grades. I questioned if it was really something that I should be pursuing."</p><p>Once he transferred to Tyler, he realized that he was in the right field, just in the wrong major.</p><p>He kept his sights set on a career in aerospace. But he switched his major from mechanical engineering to general engineering, saw his GPA skyrocket, and positioned himself for a bachelor's in aerospace engineering at Virginia Tech.</p><p>"What has surprised me the most about John Tyler is the level of difficulty of my courses," Ravonte said. "There's a stigma that community college is easy, but we learn the same things that four-year colleges teach.</p><p>"I would text my friend who's in Virginia Tech's engineering program with questions, and the difficulty of our problems would be lining up with the pace of Virginia Tech's program," he continued. "That really helps you prepare. I will be going from a two-year to a four-year, and there won't be a massive jump in difficulty."</p>
